# sprotty-theia

Glue code for [Sprotty diagrams](https://github.com/eclipse/sprotty) in [Theia](https://theia-ide.org) as [Theia extensions](https://theia-ide.org/docs/authoring_extensions). 
If you want to connect your diagram with a language server, you should rather build a [VS Code extension](https://github.com/eclipse/sprotty-vscode).
